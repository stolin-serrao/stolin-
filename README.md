## Recommendations Based on Analysis
Improving the lending portfolio involves offering various loan types, not just for debt consolidation but also for common needs like home improvements or credit card payments. 

A careful risk management approach, especially for sub-grade C loans, may involve refining approval criteria or adjusting interest rates to match the risks. Region-specific strategies, tailored for performance in key markets like California, are crucial for success.

Ensuring thorough verification processes for loan applicants is crucial, and keeping an eye on employment length trends, especially for those employed for over a decade, is advised. 

Exploring growth within the verified loan segment, through special products or campaigns for verified borrowers, is worth considering.

Maintaining a balanced portfolio requires regular assessment of loan distribution across terms and credit grades. Continuous scrutiny of payment patterns and adjusting collection strategies contribute to the overall health of the lending portfolio.

Educating customers about various loan purposes and conducting routine assessments of portfolio health aid in informed decision-making and proactive risk mitigation.
